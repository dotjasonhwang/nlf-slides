Go tell it on a mountain

# Author
John Wesley Work Jr.

#C1
Go, tell it on the mountain
Over the hills and everywhere

Go, tell it on the mountain
That Jesus Christ is born

#V1
While shepherds kept their watching
O'er silent flocks by night

Behold throughout the heavens
There shone a Holy light

#C1
Go, tell it on the mountain
Over the hills and everywhere

Go, tell it on the mountain
That Jesus Christ is born

#V2
The shepherds feared and trembled
When, lo! Above the Earth

Rang out the angel chorus
That hailed our Savior's birth

#C1
Go, tell it on the mountain
Over the hills and everywhere

Go, tell it on the mountain
That Jesus Christ is born

!

#V3
Down in a lowly manger
Our humble Christ was born

And brought us all salvation
That blessed Christmas morn

#C2
Go, tell it on the mountain
Over the hills and everywhere

Go, tell it on the mountain
That Jesus Christ is born

That Jesus Christ is born

!
