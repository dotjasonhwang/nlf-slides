/V1

While shepherds kept their watching
O'er silent flocks by night

Behold throughout the heavens
There shone a Holy light

/V2

The shepherds feared and trembled
When, lo! Above the Earth

Rang out the angel chorus
That hailed our Savior's birth

/V3

Down in a lowly manger
Our humble Christ was born

And brought us all salvation
That blessed Christmas morn

/C1

Go, tell it on the mountain
Over the hills and everywhere

Go, tell it on the mountain
That Jesus Christ is born

/C2

Go, tell it on the mountain
Over the hills and everywhere

Go, tell it on the mountain
That Jesus Christ is born

That Jesus Christ is born
